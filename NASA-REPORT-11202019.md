NASA has given up on using the thruster for small satellites for now.

NASA is using experimental Hall thruster design, very similar to design used in PowerPoint.

Experimental thruster is installed on the space station.

Thruster has output up to 19.3675 Newtons, with moderate operation at 17.8 Newton for 3 Months.
